## 练习0：填写已有实验

将 lab1 的 `kern/debug/kdebug.c`、`kern/init/init.c` 以及 `kern/trap/trap.c` 直接复制到 lab3 里

再将 lab2 的 `kern/mm/pmm.c` 和 `kern/mm/default_pmm.c` 复制到 lab3 里即可

### do_pgfault 函数源码

写于：**kern/mm/vmm.c**

```c
/* do_pgfault - interrupt handler to process the page fault execption
 * @mm         : the control struct for a set of vma using the same PDT
 * @error_code : the error code recorded in trapframe->tf_err which is setted by x86 hardware
 * @addr       : the addr which causes a memory access exception, (the contents of the CR2 register)
 *
 * CALL GRAPH: trap--> trap_dispatch-->pgfault_handler-->do_pgfault
 * The processor provides ucore's do_pgfault function with two items of information to aid in diagnosing
 * the exception and recovering from it.
 *   (1) The contents of the CR2 register. The processor loads the CR2 register with the
 *       32-bit linear address that generated the exception. The do_pgfault fun can
 *       use this address to locate the corresponding page directory and page-table
 *       entries.
 *   (2) An error code on the kernel stack. The error code for a page fault has a format different from
 *       that for other exceptions. The error code tells the exception handler three things:
 *         -- The P flag   (bit 0) indicates whether the exception was due to a not-present page (0)
 *            or to either an access rights violation or the use of a reserved bit (1).
 *         -- The W/R flag (bit 1) indicates whether the memory access that caused the exception
 *            was a read (0) or write (1).
 *         -- The U/S flag (bit 2) indicates whether the processor was executing at user mode (1)
 *            or supervisor mode (0) at the time of the exception.
